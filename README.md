This project will simulate a banking system where you can manage customers, accounts, and transactions efficiently. There are 3 classes, all under the Bank package.
The bank class is the class where our code is ran. It has the main method and this is the class that the user interacts with when they use it.

The other two classes, BankAccount and Customer, are classes that handle information relevant to the user's bank account. BankAccount is where the user's bank account details,
such as their savings or checkings accounts, are generated. The user, with the help of this class's methods, can deposit funds into their checkings/savings, or withdraw funds
from their checkings/savings.

The Customer class is where the user's personal data is constructed. Their name and address are the attributes that are collected. We set their address with the address setter
method in the class. We may also get and return their names and addresses with the related getter methods in the same class.

The expected output file is an image of an example output. Note that the entered name, Mike, and the entered address, Boston, alongside the entered numbers, do not impact
the code's functionality and that you, as the user, can enter any given name, address, or deposit/withdraw any amount of money as you wish.
